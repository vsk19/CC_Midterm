# Using my data science, design, and scripting skills, I created a generative art
# piece from CDC COVID-19 data.
#
# Hereâ€™s a link to the data source: https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36
# The data was obtained from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and is titled United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time. This data set is an aggregation of the most recent numbers from local, state, territorial, and other jurisdictions.
